# 3D-bedroom using OpenGL
This is an assignment done for my Computer Graphics lab using C++ and OpenGL. The GL, GLU and GLUT libraries were used. The bedroom was designed using cubes, pyramids and one 2D polygon.

The features of the bedroom - 
* Two point lights, one spotlight
* No textures, no curve
* A pendulum clock with a moving pendulum
* A rotating fan (can be turned on/off)
* Change eyepoint and lookat point using keys

1. w: up
2. s: down
3. a: left
4. d: right
5. i: zoom in
6. o: zoom out

To move Camera point:
1. j: up
2. n: down
3. b: left
4. m: right

6. k: move far
    

1. q to move to default position (both eyepoint & lookat point)
2. f: to turn on/off fan

To control lights:
1. 1: to turn on/off light one
2. 2: to turn on/off light two
3. 3: to turn on/off lamp
4. 4: to turn on/off ambient light one
5. 5: to turn on/off diffusion light one
6. 6: to turn on/off specular light one 
7. 7: to turn on/off ambient light two
8. 8: to turn on/off diffusion light two
9. 9: to turn on/off specular light two
10. e: to turn on/off ambient lamp light
11. r: to turn on/off diffusion lamp light
12. t: to turn on/off specular lamp light
